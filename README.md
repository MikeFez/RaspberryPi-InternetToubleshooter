# RaspberryPi Internet Toubleshooter
I went through a period where my internet sucked. Really sucked.

I'd find myself having to get up and reboot my modem and router periodically throughout the day just to maintain connectivity, and with IoT devices all over the place, this issue occuring when I wasn't home lead to frustrations.

I like to automate my life, and having a spare RaspberryPi + Outlet relay availible, I was able to code up a solution that checks for internet every 30 seconds, and resets my devices should it not be able to connect.
